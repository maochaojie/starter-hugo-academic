I am currently a research scientist at Alibaba DAMO Academy and focus on the research and application of basic fundamental models , especially the generative model and tuning methods.  

In 2018, I graduated from College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering (ISEE) at Zhejiang University, advised Prof. Zhongfei Zhang, Prof. Xi Li and Prof. Yingming Li. I also received my Bachelor in Zhejiang University.

My research interests are in visual perception and deep learning,  especially in video understanding and basic fundamental model. My works have been published in journals/conferences such as  NeurIPS, ICCV and AAAI.
